The first person is a child riding a scooter, the second person is an adult assisting a young boy on roller skates, and the third person is another child on a scooter. (please judge according to both the answer and the caption below. For the caption, only take explicitly mentioned things as evidence.)
The video begins with a child in a blue jacket and green pants riding a scooter on a concrete surface, likely in a park or recreational area. The background features trees, a body of water, and colorful triangular flags strung between poles. The child approaches a ramp and performs a trick by jumping onto it and landing back on the ground. The scene transitions to the same child continuing to ride the scooter, now moving towards a basketball hoop. The background remains consistent with trees, colorful flags, and a wooden fence. The child rides past the basketball hoop and continues along the concrete path.

Next, the child is seen riding the scooter again, still in the same park or recreational area. The background includes trees, colorful flags, and a wooden fence. The child rides towards another part of the park where another person, wearing a blue jacket and carrying a green bag, is seen holding the hand of a young boy who is roller skating. The boy is wearing a gray sweatshirt with text on it, blue pants, and protective gear on his knees and elbows. The adult and the boy walk together, with the boy roller skating alongside the adult. The background includes more trees and a wooden fence. The scene then shifts back to the child on the scooter, who is now riding towards the camera, with the adult and the boy visible in the background.

The video continues with the child in the blue jacket and green pants riding the scooter on the concrete surface. The background includes trees, colorful triangular flags strung between poles, and a wooden fence. The child rides towards the camera, with the adult and the boy visible in the background. The scene then shifts to the child riding the scooter away from the camera, with the adult and the boy walking together in the background. The child continues to ride the scooter, moving further away from the camera.

Finally, the child in the blue jacket and green pants is seen riding the scooter on the concrete surface. The background includes a wooden fence and trees. The child rides towards the camera, with the adult and the boy visible in the background. The scene then shifts to the child riding the scooter away from the camera, with the adult and the boy walking together in the background. The video concludes with the child continuing to ride the scooter, moving further away from the camera.</span></b></div><hr><div><b><span style='color: blue;'>ANSWER0</span></b>=<b><span style='color: red;'>SELECT</span></b>(<b><span style='color: darkorange;'>question</span></b>=How many people were in the video?, <b><span style='color: darkorange;'>information</span></b>=['There are three people in the video.
