In the video, there are three people visible in the kitchen setting. One person is standing and appears to be singing or speaking animatedly, while two others are seated on a bench. The standing individual is gesturing with their hands and seems to be engaged in a lively conversation or performance. The seated individuals are attentively listening or participating in the activity. (please judge according to both the answer and the caption below. For the caption, only take explicitly mentioned things as evidence.)
The video takes place in a cozy kitchen setting, featuring a group of people engaged in a lively and cheerful activity. The scene is well-lit with natural light streaming through the windows, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. 

In the foreground, there are three individuals seated on a wooden bench. Two of them are wearing white martial arts uniforms with yellow belts, indicating they might be students or practitioners of a martial art. They appear to be enjoying themselves, possibly singing or chanting together. The third person, standing to the left of the seated individuals, is dressed in a colorful floral shirt and jeans. This person seems to be leading the activity, gesturing animatedly and possibly singing or speaking to the group.

In the background, another individual is visible, standing near the kitchen counter. This person is dressed in dark clothing and appears to be observing the activity, possibly participating or supervising. The kitchen itself is equipped with modern appliances, including a stainless steel refrigerator and an oven, and has various items on the countertops, such as a vase with flowers and some kitchen utensils. The overall mood of the video is joyful and communal, suggesting a family or group gathering where everyone is involved in a shared activity.</span></b></div><hr><div><b><span style='color: blue;'>ANSWER0</span></b>=<b><span style='color: red;'>SELECT</span></b>(<b><span style='color: darkorange;'>question</span></b>=How many people are singing?, <b><span style='color: darkorange;'>information</span></b>=["The correct answer is 'three'.
