(please judge according to both the answer and the caption below. For the caption, only take explicitly mentioned things as evidence.)
The video takes place in a conference or lecture setting, featuring a woman standing on stage and presenting. She is dressed in a dark outfit and holds a microphone, indicating she is speaking to an audience. Behind her, a large screen displays a presentation slide titled "More Background." The slide provides information about the presenter's background, including points such as:

- After graduating from Bucknell and Latin program in Philadelphia, I did a Greek archaeological program.
- While there, I worked at an archaeological museum at the University of Pennsylvania and directed a summer camp.
- Working with objects and directing a summer camp.

The slide also includes two images: one of a building with columns and another of a person working with objects in a museum setting. The background of the room features wooden paneling and a ceiling with recessed lighting, creating a formal atmosphere suitable for academic or professional presentations. The woman appears to be actively engaged in her presentation, likely elaborating on the points listed on the slide. As the video progresses, the slide transitions to another section titled "More Background," detailing further educational and professional experiences:

- Graduate school at Florida State University
- Master's degree in Classical Archaeology
- Excavated in Athens, Greece
- Museum Studies Certificate in Tallahassee, Florida
- Museum Internship in Tallahassee, Florida

The slide continues to include images related to these points, such as archaeological sites and artifacts. The woman remains on stage, maintaining her presentation, and the setting remains consistent throughout the video.</span></b></div><hr><div><b><span style='color: blue;'>ANSWER0</span></b>=<b><span style='color: red;'>SELECT</span></b>(<b><span style='color: darkorange;'>question</span></b>=Where is this happening?, <b><span style='color: darkorange;'>information</span></b>=['This is happening in a presentation hall.
