(please judge according to both the answer and the caption below. For the caption, only take explicitly mentioned things as evidence.)
The video begins with a serene outdoor scene where two individuals are interacting with an owl. The person on the left, dressed in a green jacket and light-colored pants, holds the owl's wings while the person on the right, wearing a dark top and jeans, holds the owl's body. They are standing on a grassy area surrounded by leafless trees, indicating a natural setting. The person on the left then steps back, allowing the person on the right to hold the owl more securely. The person on the left gestures towards the owl, possibly explaining something about it. The person on the right adjusts their grip on the owl, ensuring it is secure.

The scene continues with the person on the left reaching out to take the owl from the person on the right. The owl flaps its wings slightly as the person on the left carefully handles it. The person on the left then holds the owl up, displaying it to the camera, while the person on the right watches attentively. The person on the left releases the owl, which flies away into the sky, showcasing its impressive wingspan against the backdrop of the leafless trees.

The focus shifts to a close-up of the owl flying through the sky, its wings spread wide. The scene transitions to a view of a forested area with a small, green birdhouse attached to a tree trunk. The birdhouse has a brown roof and a small door, blending into the natural surroundings. The owl lands on top of the birdhouse, perching calmly. The camera captures the owl from various angles, highlighting its detailed feathers and the surrounding forest environment.

The video continues to focus on the birdhouse, with the owl perched on top. The background remains consistent with leafless trees and a dense forest setting. The camera slowly pans around the birdhouse, providing different perspectives of the owl and the surrounding trees. The owl occasionally moves slightly but remains perched on the birdhouse.

The scene then transitions to a wider view of the forested area, showing the birdhouse and the surrounding trees. The camera captures the natural beauty of the forest, with sunlight filtering through the branches. The owl is no longer visible, suggesting it may have flown away or moved out of the frame.

The video concludes with a blurred motion shot of the forest, indicating rapid movement. The scene clears to reveal the same two individuals from the previous clips. The person on the left, still in a green jacket and light-colored pants, is holding the owl's wings, while the person on the right, now wearing a</span></b></div><hr><div><b><span style='color: blue;'>ANSWER0</span></b>=<b><span style='color: red;'>SELECT</span></b>(<b><span style='color: darkorange;'>question</span></b>=Where is this happening?, <b><span style='color: darkorange;'>information</span></b>=["This is happening outdoors.
