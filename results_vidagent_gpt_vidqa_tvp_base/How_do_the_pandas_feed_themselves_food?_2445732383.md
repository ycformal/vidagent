Pandas use their paws to feed themselves food. They have strong, dexterous paws that they use to grasp and tear apart bamboo, which is their primary food source. This is a natural behavior for pandas in the wild and is also observed in captive pandas. The other options listed are not typical behaviors for pandas when feeding. For example, 'put food in hands' is not how pandas eat, as they do not have hands like humans. 'Lying on the mattress' is a behavior associated with resting or sleeping, not eating. 'Drink' is not applicable to pandas as they primarily eat bamboo. 'With its trunk' is not accurate either, as pandas do not use their trunks to eat. (please judge according to both the answer and the caption below. For the caption, only take explicitly mentioned things as evidence.)
The video begins with a completely black screen, devoid of any visible content. Gradually, the screen transitions to a static-filled image, where numerous small, colored dots appear against a predominantly white background. These dots are scattered across the screen, creating a pattern that resembles static noise. The colors of the dots vary, including shades of red, green, blue, and yellow. As the video progresses, the static-filled image remains consistent, with the colored dots continuing to be the primary visual element. The scene then shifts to a similar black screen, but this time, the colored dots are more concentrated at the bottom of the screen. The colors remain the same, and the static noise effect persists. The video continues to show the black screen with the colored dots at the bottom, maintaining the static noise effect throughout. The final part of the video maintains this static-filled image, with the colored dots still present at the bottom of the screen, creating a consistent visual theme from start to finish.</span></b></div><hr><div><b><span style='color: blue;'>ANSWER0</span></b>=<b><span style='color: red;'>SELECT</span></b>(<b><span style='color: darkorange;'>question</span></b>=How do the pandas feed themselves food?, <b><span style='color: darkorange;'>information</span></b>=["The correct answer is 'using paws'.
