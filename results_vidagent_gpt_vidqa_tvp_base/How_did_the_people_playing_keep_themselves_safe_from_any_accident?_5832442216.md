(please judge according to both the answer and the caption below. For the caption, only take explicitly mentioned things as evidence.)
The video showcases two individuals engaged in a fencing bout within an indoor fencing facility. Both participants are dressed in traditional fencing attire, including white jackets, protective masks, and gloves. The fencer on the left is wearing dark shorts and white socks, while the fencer on the right is wearing black pants with red accents and a blue mask. They are positioned on a white strip marked with blue lines, which serves as the designated fencing area.

Throughout the video, the fencers demonstrate various movements typical of a fencing match, such as advancing, retreating, lunging, and parrying. Their actions are precise and controlled, reflecting the discipline and skill required in the sport. The background features a dark blue wall adorned with a large mural of a fencer in action, adding to the ambiance of the fencing hall. To the right, there is a table with various items, including what appears to be fencing equipment and possibly some personal belongings. The floor around the fencing strip is scattered with bags and other equipment, indicating an active training environment.

The lighting in the room is bright, ensuring clear visibility for both the fencers and any spectators or coaches who might be present. The overall setting suggests a dedicated space for fencing practice, emphasizing the seriousness and dedication of the participants.</span></b></div><hr><div><b><span style='color: blue;'>ANSWER0</span></b>=<b><span style='color: red;'>SELECT</span></b>(<b><span style='color: darkorange;'>question</span></b>=How did the people playing keep themselves safe from any accident?, <b><span style='color: darkorange;'>information</span></b>=['The people playing are wearing headgear to keep themselves safe from any accident.
