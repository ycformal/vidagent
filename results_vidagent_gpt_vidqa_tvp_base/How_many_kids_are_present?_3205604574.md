The video features two children, a boy and a girl, engaging in playful activities together. The boy is seen wearing star-shaped glasses and holding a toy microphone, while the girl is dressed in a pink outfit with a bow in her hair. They are both interacting with a toy set that includes a small table with various colorful buttons and lights. The boy appears to be singing or speaking into the microphone, while the girl watches and occasionally mimics his actions. The setting is indoors, possibly in a living room or play area, with a door visible in the background. (please judge according to both the answer and the caption below. For the caption, only take explicitly mentioned things as evidence.)
The video features two children in a dimly lit room, engaging in playful activities. The child on the left is dressed in light-colored pajamas and is seated at a small table with a toy keyboard that has yellow and red buttons. This child is holding a blue microphone and appears to be singing or speaking into it, making various hand gestures such as pointing and waving. The child on the right, wearing a pink sweater and a hair clip, stands nearby, watching and occasionally mimicking the actions of the child at the table. The background includes an open door leading to a darker area, possibly another room or hallway. The scene is casual and playful, with both children appearing to enjoy their time together. The child at the table continues to sing or speak into the microphone, while the child in the pink sweater moves closer to the camera, eventually standing very close to it. The child at the table then makes a peace sign with one hand while continuing to sing or speak into the microphone. The video concludes with the child at the table still engaged in their activity, while the other child is no longer visible in the frame.</span></b></div><hr><div><b><span style='color: blue;'>ANSWER0</span></b>=<b><span style='color: red;'>SELECT</span></b>(<b><span style='color: darkorange;'>question</span></b>=How many kids are present?, <b><span style='color: darkorange;'>information</span></b>=['The correct answer is two.
