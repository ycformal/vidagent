The video begins with a person wearing a black and white striped jersey, blue pants, and a black helmet holding a football. The background shows a grassy field with trees, houses, and parked cars. The person is seen running on the field, passing the football to another player who is wearing a white shirt and gray shorts. The scene transitions to a close-up of the person in the striped jersey, now standing still and looking around. The next frame shows two players, one in a white jersey with red accents and the other in a black jersey, both wearing helmets, standing near a playground with slides and swings. The background includes more trees and houses. The video then shows a person in a white shirt and gray shorts running on the field, wearing a black helmet with a logo on it. The background includes trees, houses, and a yellow school bus parked near a fence. The person is seen running towards the camera, then falling to the ground and getting up. The final frame shows the person in the white shirt and gray shorts holding a football, preparing to throw it, while another player in a white jersey with red accents stands nearby.</span></b></div><hr><div><b><span style='color: blue;'>ANSWER0</span></b>=<b><span style='color: red;'>SELECT</span></b>(<b><span style='color: darkorange;'>question</span></b>=How did the players protect their heads from injury?, <b><span style='color: darkorange;'>information</span></b>=['The players protected their heads from injury by wearing helmets.
