The background outside the car shows a busy street with palm trees and buildings. The camera captures the interaction between the two women, with the woman in the green patterned top occasionally gesturing with her hands.

LLM analysis:

The initial guess is **disappointed** with a confidence score of 0.7 (70%), which is above the 60% threshold.

Reviewing the provided information:

- The per-frame VQA responses mostly indicate feelings such as frustration, impatience, stress, and discomfort related to being stuck in traffic. These are negative emotions but do not explicitly mention "disappointed" as a feeling. However, "disappointed" can be considered a related negative emotion.

- The video caption describes people talking and gesturing, with no explicit mention of positive emotions like "likes it" or "excited," nor does it mention boredom or sadness explicitly.

- None of the captions or VQA responses explicitly support "likes it," "excited," "bored," or "sad" as the primary feelings.

- Since the initial guess "disappointed" has a confidence above 60% and no other option is explicitly supported by the captions or VQA, the best choice is to trust the initial guess.

**Final answer:** disappointed

Answer: 2
