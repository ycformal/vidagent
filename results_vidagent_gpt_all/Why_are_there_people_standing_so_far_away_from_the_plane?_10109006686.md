LLM analysis:

The initial guess is "cant go nearby" with a confidence of about 51.6%, which is just below 60%. The video caption and per-frame captions describe people standing at a distance from the plane, observing it as it approaches and lands on the runway. The per-frame VQA answers consistently explain that the people are standing far away to maintain a safe distance, avoid hazards, and follow standard safety protocols at airports.

No other choice is explicitly supported by the captions or VQA:

- "climbed higher and further" is unrelated to the context.
- "restricted environment" is not explicitly mentioned.
- "trying to land" applies to the plane, not the people.
- "prevent getting washed away" is irrelevant.
