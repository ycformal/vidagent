LLM analysis:

The initial guess is "two" with a confidence score of 0.7 (70%), which is above the 60% threshold.

The video caption describes heavily glitched, abstract, and pixelated black-and-white images with no discernible subjects or actions, and explicitly states that there are no discernible objects or subjects visible. Therefore, the video caption does **not** explicitly support any number of people performing on the stage.

The per-frame VQA answers vary, mentioning "no people," "two people," "three people," "four people," and "multiple people but exact number cannot be determined." However, the initial guess "two" is based on the VLM answer and has a confidence of 0.7, which is above the threshold to override it.

Since the caption does not explicitly support any other number, and the initial guess confidence is above 60%, we should trust the initial guess.

**Final answer:** two

Answer: 2
