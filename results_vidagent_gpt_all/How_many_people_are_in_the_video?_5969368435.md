LLM analysis:

Let's analyze the information step-by-step:

1. **Per frame VQA answers** vary between 1 to 5 people visible, with multiple frames indicating 3 or 4 people, and a few frames indicating 5 people visible.

2. **Per frame captions** describe groups of people on a snowy hill, often mentioning 2, 3, or 4 people, sometimes mentioning children and adults, sleds, snowboards, and footprints. The captions do not explicitly mention exactly 5 people at once, but do mention groups of 3 or 4 people multiple times.

3. **Video caption** describes several children playing on a snowy hill, mentioning:
   - A child in a pink jacket at the top of the hill.
   - Another child in dark clothing sliding down.
   - A child in a green jacket holding a blue sled.
   - More children joining in, including one in dark clothing running up the hill.
   - Multiple children sliding, falling, standing, or walking around.
   
   The video caption implies multiple children, at least 3 or 4, but does not explicitly state the total number of people. It does not explicitly mention 5 people, but the VLM answer is "five" with confidence 0.7.

4. **Initial guess** is "five" with confidence 0.7 (70%).

5. **Instruction on trusting caption**: Trust the caption only if it explicitly supports another answer and the initial guess confidence is below 60%. Here, initial guess confidence is 70%, so we do not need to override it unless the caption explicitly supports a different number.

6. The caption does not explicitly mention "five" people or any other number that contradicts the initial guess.

**Conclusion:**

- The initial guess is "five" with 70% confidence.
- The captions do not explicitly contradict or support a different number.
- Therefore, per instructions, we trust the initial guess.

**Final answer:**

**five**

Answer: 3
