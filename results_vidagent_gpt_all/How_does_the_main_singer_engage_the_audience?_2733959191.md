LLM analysis:

The per frame VQA answers consistently describe the main singer engaging the audience through direct eye contact, expressive facial gestures, and dynamic body movements. There is no mention of "touch their hands" or any other specific action like walking forward, jumping down stage, or motioning with his head.

The video caption and per frame captions describe abstract black and white patterns and minimalist designs, with no mention of any singer or audience engagement actions.

The VLM answer is "touch their hands" with a confidence score of about 0.76 (76%), which is above the 60% threshold.

Since the caption does not explicitly support any other option, and the initial guess confidence is above 60%, we should trust the initial guess.

**Final answer:** touch their hands

Answer: 3
