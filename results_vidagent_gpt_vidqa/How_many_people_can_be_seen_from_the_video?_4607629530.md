The video features three individuals: one person holding a camera, another seated on the left wearing a black shirt with a yellow design and shorts, and a third person seated on the right wearing a dark shirt and jeans. The interactions among these three individuals are captured throughout the video, with the person in the middle being the primary focus of the conversation. (please judge according to both the answer and the caption below. For the caption, only take explicitly mentioned things as evidence.)
The video takes place in a well-lit room with large windows, featuring a casual and relaxed atmosphere. Initially, three individuals are present: one standing and holding a professional video camera, another seated on the left wearing a black t-shirt with a yellow design, and a third person seated on the right, also dressed in a black t-shirt. The background includes a refrigerator adorned with various items and notes, a counter with a microwave, and other kitchen appliances.

As the video progresses, the focus shifts to two individuals seated on stools in front of the large windows. The person on the left is dressed in a dark long-sleeve shirt and jeans, while the person on the right wears a black t-shirt with a yellow hexagonal design and shorts. They appear to be engaged in a conversation, with the person on the left gesturing with their hands and the person on the right listening attentively. The background remains consistent, showing the same kitchen appliances and a water dispenser with bottles.

The scene continues with the same two individuals, maintaining their positions and attire. The person on the left continues to gesture while talking, and the person on the right listens and occasionally responds. The setting remains unchanged, with the refrigerator, microwave, and water dispenser still visible.

Towards the end of the video, the camera pans to reveal more of the room, including additional people and equipment. One individual is seen sitting at a table with a laptop and a can of soda, while another person is partially visible in the background. The video concludes with a return to the two individuals on the stools, who continue their conversation with the same relaxed demeanor.</span></b></div><hr><div><b><span style='color: blue;'>ANSWER0</span></b>=<b><span style='color: red;'>SELECT</span></b>(<b><span style='color: darkorange;'>question</span></b>=How many people can be seen from the video?, <b><span style='color: darkorange;'>information</span></b>=["The correct answer is 'three'.
