(please judge according to both the answer and the caption below. For the caption, only take explicitly mentioned things as evidence.)
The video features a man standing behind a podium in what appears to be a game show or quiz competition setting. The background prominently displays a large screen with multiple rows of yellow text on a dark background, indicating different categories and their respective point values. The categories include "ART," "SAINT AGNES," "MOTHER'S DAY," "ITALIAN-AMERICAN," and "PATRON SAINT OF IMMIGRANTS." Each category has a series of numbers ranging from $400 to $2000, suggesting the point values for answering questions correctly.

Initially, the man is seen standing behind the podium, which has a transparent front panel and a digital display showing the current score as 0-400. The background screen shows the "ART" category with various point values. The scene transitions to a close-up of the screen, revealing a question: "IN ART, SAINT AGNES IS OFTEN DEPICTED AS HOLDING THIS YOUNG ANIMAL, A SYMBOL OF INNOCENCE & PURITY." The man continues to stand behind the podium, with the same background screen displaying the question.

The video progresses with the man still at the podium, and the background screen now shows the same question about Saint Agnes. The digital display on the podium remains unchanged at 0-400. The scene then transitions back to the large screen, which now displays the "ITALIAN-AMERICAN" category with the question: "AN IMMIGRANT HERSELF, THIS ITALIAN-AMERICAN 'MOTHER' IS THE PATRON SAINT OF IMMIGRANTS." The man continues to stand behind the podium, with the background screen showing this new question.

In the final segment, the man is still at the podium, and the background screen displays the same question about the Italian-American "Mother" who is the patron saint of immigrants. The digital display on the podium shows the current score as 0-1200. The scene transitions back to the large screen, which now displays the "ART" category with various point values. The man continues to stand behind the podium, with the background screen showing the updated question and point values.

Throughout the video, the man appears to be hosting the game show, providing information or instructions related to the questions displayed on the screen. The consistent elements, such as the podium, the digital display, and the background screen, reinforce the setting of a game show or quiz competition.</span></b></div><hr><div><b><span style='color: blue;'>ANSWER0</span></b>=<b><span style='color: red;'>SELECT</span></b>(<b><span style='color: darkorange;'>question</span></b>=What is the man hosting?, <b><span style='color: darkorange;'>information</span></b>=['The man is hosting a game show.
