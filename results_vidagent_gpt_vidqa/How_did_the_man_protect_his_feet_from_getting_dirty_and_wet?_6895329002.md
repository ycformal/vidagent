(please judge according to both the answer and the caption below. For the caption, only take explicitly mentioned things as evidence.)
The video begins with a man walking through an indoor area, possibly a kennel or animal shelter. He is dressed in a dark shirt, light-colored pants, and black boots. A brown dog with a blue collar is on a leash, following closely behind him. The floor appears wet, suggesting recent cleaning or water spillage. As they move forward, the man passes by metal cages containing other dogs, indicating that this is a place where animals are kept. The background includes various items such as ropes and equipment, reinforcing the setting of an animal care facility.

The scene develops as the man continues to walk down a narrow corridor lined with red metal barriers on one side and various items like ropes and equipment on the other. The dog remains on the leash, staying close to the man. They pass by more metal cages and other enclosed areas, further emphasizing the animal care environment. The corridor is well-lit with overhead lights, and the wet floor suggests ongoing maintenance or cleaning activities.

The video wraps up with the man and the dog still walking down the same narrow corridor. The corridor remains lined with red metal barriers and various items, including ropes and equipment. The man and the dog continue to move forward, passing by more metal cages and enclosed areas. The corridor is well-lit with overhead lights, and the wet floor indicates ongoing maintenance or cleaning activities. The video concludes with the man and the dog approaching another section of the corridor, maintaining their steady pace.</span></b></div><hr><div><b><span style='color: blue;'>ANSWER0</span></b>=<b><span style='color: red;'>SELECT</span></b>(<b><span style='color: darkorange;'>question</span></b>=How did the man protect his feet from getting dirty and wet?, <b><span style='color: darkorange;'>information</span></b>=['The man protected his feet by wearing boots.
