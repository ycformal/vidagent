Therefore, the correct answer is 'one'. (please judge according to both the answer and the caption below. For the caption, only take explicitly mentioned things as evidence.)
The video showcases a serene underwater scene within an aquarium. It begins with a close-up view of a stingray, characterized by its flat, diamond-shaped body and long tail, swimming gracefully over a sandy bottom. The background features a dark blue wall adorned with green aquatic plants and some rocks, creating a naturalistic environment. The stingray moves fluidly, occasionally pausing to rest on the sandy floor or near a rock.

As the video progresses, another fish, possibly a larger species like a grouper, enters the frame from the left side. This fish has a streamlined body and is seen swimming towards the stingray. The interaction between the two fish is subtle, with the larger fish approaching the stingray but not engaging directly. The stingray remains mostly stationary, occasionally shifting its position slightly.

The scene continues with the stingray still in the foreground, maintaining its position near the sandy bottom. The larger fish is now closer, hovering near the stingray's head. The background remains consistent, with the dark blue wall, green plants, and rocks providing a stable backdrop. The interaction between the two fish is minimal, with the larger fish appearing curious but not initiating any aggressive behavior.

The video wraps up with the stingray continuing to rest on the sandy floor, while the larger fish stays nearby, observing it. The overall atmosphere of the video is calm and tranquil, highlighting the peaceful coexistence of different marine life within the aquarium.</span></b></div><hr><div><b><span style='color: blue;'>ANSWER0</span></b>=<b><span style='color: red;'>SELECT</span></b>(<b><span style='color: darkorange;'>question</span></b>=How many pets are there in the tank?, <b><span style='color: darkorange;'>information</span></b>=["The video shows a single stingray swimming in the tank.
