The video features two cats, a tabby cat and an orange cat, interacting in various settings. They are seen walking, sniffing around, and exploring their surroundings. The presence of both cats throughout the video confirms that there are only two cats involved. (please judge according to both the answer and the caption below. For the caption, only take explicitly mentioned things as evidence.)
The video features two cats, one with a striped coat and the other with an orange coat, in a parking lot setting. The scene opens with both cats walking across the parking lot, which is marked with white lines and has several green and gray objects placed on the ground. The striped cat leads the way, while the orange cat follows closely behind. As they move, they pass by red traffic cones and a white railing, with the striped cat occasionally stopping to sniff the ground or look around.

The narrative continues with the striped cat sitting down while the orange cat stands nearby, both appearing curious about their surroundings. The striped cat then gets up and starts walking again, followed by the orange cat. They navigate around the red traffic cones and continue their exploration of the parking lot.

As the video progresses, the striped cat walks past a white line on the ground, while the orange cat follows closely behind. They move towards a corrugated metal wall, where the striped cat sniffs around a pole, and the orange cat watches attentively. The striped cat then sits down near the pole, eating some food scattered on the ground, while the orange cat remains standing nearby, observing.

The scene develops further with the striped cat continuing to eat near the pole, and the orange cat sitting on the ground, watching the striped cat. The striped cat finishes its meal and begins to walk away from the pole, while the orange cat stays seated, looking around.

The video wraps up with the striped cat lying down near the pole, still eating, while the orange cat remains seated, observing. The striped cat continues to eat, occasionally glancing up at the orange cat, who stays seated and attentive. The video concludes with the striped cat still eating near the pole, and the orange cat lying down next to it, both appearing content in their surroundings.</span></b></div><hr><div><b><span style='color: blue;'>ANSWER0</span></b>=<b><span style='color: red;'>SELECT</span></b>(<b><span style='color: darkorange;'>question</span></b>=How many cats are there?, <b><span style='color: darkorange;'>information</span></b>=["The correct answer is 'two'.
