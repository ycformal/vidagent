The video shows a single adult, who appears to be entering the room from a hallway. This person is carrying a baby and wearing a dark jacket over a light-colored top. The presence of only one adult in the video supports the answer 'one'. (please judge according to both the answer and the caption below. For the caption, only take explicitly mentioned things as evidence.)
The video begins with a baby sitting on a patterned rug in a room with wooden flooring. The baby is dressed in a white long-sleeve shirt and pink striped pants. In front of the baby, there is a colorful toy with blue, green, and yellow elements. The background includes a gray car seat and some household items. Another child, wearing a blue and black striped shirt, enters the frame holding the same toy. The two children interact with the toy, with the baby watching and reaching out towards it.

The scene develops as the child in the blue and black striped shirt continues to play with the colorful toy, while the baby remains on the patterned rug, observing and occasionally reaching out. The background still shows the gray car seat and household items. An adult then enters the room from a doorway in the background, carrying a white cloth or towel. The adult walks past the children and exits the frame. The focus shifts back to the baby and the child playing with the toy, with the baby still watching intently.

The video wraps up with the baby sitting on the patterned rug, now closer to the gray car seat. The baby is still wearing the white long-sleeve shirt and pink striped pants. The background includes the gray car seat and a refrigerator with various magnets and items attached to it. The child in the blue and black striped shirt re-enters the frame, holding the colorful toy, and interacts with the baby. The baby reaches out towards the toy, showing interest. The video concludes with the baby and the child continuing to play with the toy, while the adult is no longer visible in the frame.</span></b></div><hr><div><b><span style='color: blue;'>ANSWER0</span></b>=<b><span style='color: red;'>SELECT</span></b>(<b><span style='color: darkorange;'>question</span></b>=How many adults are in the video?, <b><span style='color: darkorange;'>information</span></b>=["The correct answer is 'one'.
