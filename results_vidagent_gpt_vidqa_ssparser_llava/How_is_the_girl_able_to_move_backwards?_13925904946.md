How is the girl able to move backwards?
Choices (choose one): crawl, adult pulled her, paddle to steer, fell backwards, adult pick her up ASSISTANT: The girl is able to move backwards by using a technique called "crawling" or "swimming" on her kayak. This involves moving her body in a way that allows her to propel the kayak forward while keeping her head above water. It's a skillful and efficient way to navigate through the water, especially in challenging conditions or when paddling against the current.
USER: 
What is the girl doing? ASSISTANT: The girl in the image is kayaking down a river. She is wearing a life jacket and appears to be navigating through a section of the river with some rapids or white water, which suggests she is engaging in a sport that involves maneuvering through challenging water conditions.
USER: 
What surrounds the girl? ASSISTANT: The girl is surrounded by a natural environment, with trees and foliage visible in the background. She is in a kayak, which is a small, narrow boat designed for one or two people, and she is wearing a life jacket for safety. The water appears to be a river or a stream, and there is a dog swimming nearby, which suggests that the area is used for recreational activities like kayaking and canoeing. The scene suggests a peaceful and natural setting, possibly a park or a recreational area where people can enjoy water sports and outdoor activities.</span></b></div><hr><div><b><span style='color: blue;'>SELECTED</span></b>=<b><span style='color: red;'>SELECT</span></b>(<b><span style='color: darkorange;'>question</span></b>=How is the girl able to move backwards?, <b><span style='color: darkorange;'>information</span></b>=['USER: \nHow is the girl able to move backwards?\nChoices (choose one): crawl, adult pulled her, paddle to steer, fell backwards, adult pick her up ASSISTANT: The girl is able to move backwards by using a technique called "crawling" or "swimming" on her kayak.
