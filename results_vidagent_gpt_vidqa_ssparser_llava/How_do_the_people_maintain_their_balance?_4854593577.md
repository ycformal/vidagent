Choices (choose one): hold rope, hold strings, stand on one leg, hold raft tightly, focus on the target ASSISTANT: To maintain balance while riding on the raft, the people should hold onto the rope or strings that are attached to the raft. They should also ensure that they are wearing life jackets for safety and are seated in a way that allows them to maintain their balance. They should focus on the target, which is likely the direction they are heading or the point they are trying to reach, and adjust their body position accordingly to stay upright and stable on the raft.
