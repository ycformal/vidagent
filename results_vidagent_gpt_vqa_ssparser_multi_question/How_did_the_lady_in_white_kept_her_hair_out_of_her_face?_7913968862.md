This is a common practice among individuals who engage in physical activities, as it helps to keep hair from obstructing their vision and allows them to focus on their workout. The headband also helps to keep sweat and hair from dripping into their eyes, which can be uncomfortable and distracting during exercise.\n\nNote: This is not a continuous conversation.
