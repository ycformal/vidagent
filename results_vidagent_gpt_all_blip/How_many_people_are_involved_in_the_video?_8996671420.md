The corridor is clean and modern, with a polished floor reflecting the overhead lights. On the left side of the corridor, there are several digital screens displaying advertisements for the iPhone 3G S. One of the screens shows an image of an iPhone with the text "iPhone 3G S" and "Phone terbaik dan terhebat" (the best and most excellent phone), indicating that the advertisement is promoting the iPhone 3G S as a superior mobile device. Another screen displays the text "maxis" along with an image of a smartphone.

A person wearing a green backpack and carrying a black bag walks down the corridor from the right side of the frame towards the left. This individual appears to be in motion, possibly walking at a steady pace. As they walk, they pass by the digital screens, which continue to display the advertisements for the iPhone 3G S. The corridor is relatively empty, with only a few other people visible in the distance, contributing to a calm and uncluttered atmosphere.

The video continues to show the same corridor, maintaining its clean and modern aesthetic. The digital screens on the left wall still display the advertisements for the iPhone 3G S, reinforcing the promotional message. The person in the green backpack and black bag is now further down the corridor, moving closer to the camera. The corridor remains well-lit, and the polished floor reflects the overhead lights, enhancing the overall brightness of the scene. The few other people visible in the distance continue to add to the sense of a quiet, uncluttered environment.

The video wraps up with the person in the green backpack and black bag nearing the end of the corridor, still walking steadily. The consistent presence of the iPhone 3G S advertisements and the clean, modern design of the corridor create a cohesive and visually appealing narrative throughout the video.(trust the caption **only if** it **explicitly** mentions evidence that fully supports another answer. **Events that are not mentioned should not be considered as incorrect.**)

LLM analysis:

The caption and per-frame captions consistently describe one main person walking down the corridor with a green backpack and a black bag. It also mentions "a few other people visible in the distance," but does not specify how many exactly. The VLM answer is "two," which likely counts the main person plus one other person visible.

The question is "How many people are involved in the video?" with choices: four, two, three, five, six.

- The caption explicitly mentions one main person walking.
- It mentions "a few other people visible in the distance," which could be one or more, but no exact number is given.
- The VLM answer is two.
- The per-frame captions mention "a few other people" or "several other people," but no exact count.
- The question asks for the best choice based on the given information.

Given the VLM answer and the caption, the best supported number is **two** people involved (the main person plus one other person visible).

**Final answer: two**

Answer: 1
