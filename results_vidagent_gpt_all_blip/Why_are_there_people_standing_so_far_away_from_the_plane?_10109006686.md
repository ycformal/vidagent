LLM analysis:

The initial guess is "cant go nearby" with a confidence score of about 51.6%, which is just above 50% but below 60%. According to the instructions, we should trust the caption only if it explicitly supports another answer and the initial guess confidence is below 60%.

Reviewing the video caption and per-frame captions:

- The video caption describes people standing near the edge of the field, observing the plane landing on a runway in a grassy field.
- There is no explicit mention of a "restricted environment" or any other reason like "prevent getting washed away" or "climbed higher and further."
- The people are watching the plane land, but the caption does not say they are "trying to land" themselves.
- The presence of a fence in some frames and the people standing at a distance suggests a safety precaution or restriction on proximity to the plane.

Given this, the best-supported answer is "cant go nearby" (i.e., they are standing far away for safety reasons or because they are not allowed closer).

**Final answer:** cant go nearby

Answer: 2
