The setting appears to be outdoors, likely during winter, as indicated by the snowfall and the presence of snow on the ground and the wooden surface. The birds are primarily brown with some having distinctive white and black markings on their wings and tails. They are actively pecking at the birdseed scattered across the wooden surface.

In the initial frames, one bird is prominently visible in the center, distinguished by its yellowish-green head and chest, while the rest of the birds have more muted coloring. As the video progresses, additional birds join the scene, and they all appear to be foraging for food. The snowflakes are falling steadily, adding to the wintry atmosphere.

The birds exhibit typical behavior foraging for food, moving around the wooden surface, and occasionally pecking at the seeds. Some birds are seen fluffing their feathers, possibly to stay warm in the cold weather. The background is mostly obscured by the falling snow, but it seems to be a natural outdoor environment.

The video captures the essence of wildlife behavior during harsh weather conditions, highlighting the resilience and adaptability of these birds as they search for sustenance amidst the snow.(trust the caption **only if** it **explicitly** mentions evidence that fully supports another answer. **Events that are not mentioned should not be considered as incorrect.**)
