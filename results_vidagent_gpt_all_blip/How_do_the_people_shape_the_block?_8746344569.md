The setting appears to be a workshop or laboratory, indicated by the presence of various tools and materials on the table. Three individuals are involved in this activity:

1. **Person in the Light Blue Denim Jacket**: This individual is wearing a light blue denim jacket over a black shirt and is seen handling the blocks with precision. They use a can of spray, possibly for cleaning or applying a substance to the blocks.

2. **Person in the Red Plaid Shirt**: This person is wearing a red plaid shirt and is also engaged in handling the blocks. They work closely with the person in the denim jacket, indicating a coordinated effort.

3. **Person in the White Lab Coat**: This individual is dressed in a white lab coat, suggesting a role that may involve supervision or specialized tasks. They are also involved in the process, contributing to the assembly or arrangement of the blocks.

The table is cluttered with various items, including a yellow box, a can of spray, and other tools, which are essential for the task at hand. The background includes additional equipment and materials, reinforcing the workshop or laboratory environment.

Throughout the video, the individuals are focused on their task, carefully arranging and possibly assembling the blocks. The sequence of frames shows them in different stages of handling the blocks, emphasizing the detailed and methodical nature of their work. The consistent presence of the blue cutting mat and the array of tools and materials on the table underscores the organized and systematic approach to their task.

In summary, the video captures a detailed and collaborative effort among three individuals working together to handle and arrange white rectangular blocks in a workshop or laboratory setting, highlighting the precision and coordination required for their task.(trust the caption **only if** it **explicitly** mentions evidence that fully supports another answer. **Events that are not mentioned should not be considered as incorrect.**)

LLM analysis:

The per-frame VQA answers repeatedly mention actions like "squeezing it with their hands," "slicing it with a knife," "cutting it with a knife," and "using a sanding machine/sander/sandblaster to shape the block." The per-frame captions describe people working carefully with white blocks on a blue cutting mat, using various tools and their hands.

The video caption describes a collaborative, meticulous process involving handling and arranging white rectangular blocks, with no explicit mention of hitting the blocks or using a machine to shape them. It mentions spray cans and tools but does not say anything about hitting the blocks.

The VLM answer is "hit the side of block" with confidence 0.7 (70%), which is above the 60% threshold.

The question is: How do the people shape the block?

Choices:  
- put in machine  
- hit the side of block  
- standing on it  
- bend it  
- wheels

From the per-frame VQA, the dominant shaping methods are slicing, cutting, squeezing, and sanding. None of these correspond to "standing on it" or "wheels." "Put in machine" is mentioned vaguely as "using a sanding machine," but the per-frame captions and video caption do not explicitly say the blocks are shaped by putting them in a machine. The sanding is done by hand or with a sanding machine, but the exact method is not fully clear.

The VLM answer "hit the side of block" is confident (70%), but the video caption and per-frame captions do not mention hitting the block.

The instructions say to trust the caption only if it explicitly supports an option and VLM confidence is below 60%. Here, VLM confidence is 70%, so we do not need to trust the caption over VLM.

Therefore, the best choice based on the given information and VLM confidence is:

**"hit the side of block"**

# Final answer: hit the side of block

Answer: 1
