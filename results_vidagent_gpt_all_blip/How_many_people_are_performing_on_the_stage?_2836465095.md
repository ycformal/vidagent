LLM analysis:

The per-frame VQA answers are mostly "two," with the first frame being "three." The per-frame captions describe abstract, minimalist images with dots and textures, no mention of people or a stage. The overall video caption describes a digital glitch/distortion effect with lines and colors, no mention of people or a stage.

The question is: "How many people are performing on the stage?" with choices: four, nine, two, six, five.

- The video caption does not mention any people or a stage.
- The per-frame captions describe abstract images, no people or stage.
- The per-frame VQA mostly says "two," which might be the model's guess based on some visual cues.
- The VLM answer is "five."

The instructions say to trust the caption only if it explicitly mentions evidence that fully supports another answer. The caption does not mention any people or stage, so it does not contradict or support any number of people.

Given that the visual descriptions do not mention people or a stage, and the VQA mostly says "two," the best choice is "two."

**Final answer: two**

Answer: 2
