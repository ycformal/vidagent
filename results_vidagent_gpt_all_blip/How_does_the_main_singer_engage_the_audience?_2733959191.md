LLM analysis:

The per-frame VQA answers mostly describe the main singer engaging the audience by singing in a way that makes the audience feel part of the song, making eye contact, interacting with the audience, and singing passionately. There is no mention of physical actions like walking forward, jumping down the stage, moving while singing, or motioning with his head.

The video caption describes static, corrupted, or distorted images with no discernible content or movement, so it does not provide any evidence supporting any of the physical engagement options.

The VLM answer is "touch their hands" with a confidence of about 43%, which is below 60%, so we consider the caption for confirmation. However, the caption does not mention any hand touching or physical interaction.

Given that the caption does not explicitly support any option and the VLM answer has less than 60% confidence, we rely on the VQA answers that emphasize interaction and engagement but do not specify "touch their hands" explicitly.

Among the choices:

- "walk forward" — no mention in any caption or VQA.
- "jump down stage" — no mention.
- "moving while singing" — no mention.
- "touch their hands" — VLM suggests this but low confidence and no caption support.
- "motioned with his head" — no mention.

Since the VLM answer is the only one remotely related to physical engagement and no other option is supported, the best choice is **"touch their hands"**.

**Final answer:** touch their hands

Answer: 3
