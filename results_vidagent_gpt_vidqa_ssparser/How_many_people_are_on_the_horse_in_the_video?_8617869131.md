The rider, dressed in a white t-shirt and green shorts, guides the horse steadily forward. Another individual, wearing plaid shorts, walks alongside the horse, holding its reins to assist in controlling it. The background features a picturesque coastal landscape with gentle waves lapping at the shore, distant buildings, and lush greenery, including palm trees.

As the scene develops, the rider on the horse continues to move forward, maintaining a steady pace. The person in plaid shorts remains close by, ensuring the horse stays on course. The beach setting remains consistent, with the ocean waves and scenic backdrop providing a tranquil atmosphere.

The narrative progresses with the rider and the horse moving further along the beach, still accompanied by the individual in plaid shorts. The beach setting remains unchanged, with the ocean waves gently crashing onto the shore and the distant buildings and greenery still visible in the background.

The video wraps up with the rider and the horse continuing their journey along the beach. The person in plaid shorts continues to walk beside them, holding the reins. The beach setting remains consistent, with the ocean waves and scenic backdrop providing a tranquil atmosphere. The overall mood of the video is peaceful and leisurely, capturing a moment of calm and enjoyment on the beach.(trust the caption **only if** it **explicitly** mentions evidence that fully supports another answer. **Events that are not mentioned should not be considered as incorrect.**)
