Initially, there are three people visible: one person wearing a dark shirt and shorts, another in a white shirt and dark pants, and a third person in a white shirt and cap.

Another individual in a blue shirt and jeans enters from the right side of the frame, holding some items.

Throughout the video, the atmosphere remains casual and relaxed, with everyone appearing to enjoy the moment.
