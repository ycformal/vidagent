The scene transitions smoothly to the same sandy beach and clear blue sky. The white SUV is now further along the beach, still partially submerged in shallow water. The person in the light-colored jacket and dark shorts is now closer to the vehicle, walking barefoot on the wet sand. The camera angle remains consistent, maintaining focus on the car and the person. The person continues to walk towards the vehicle, which is now almost out of the water and onto the dry sand. The video concludes with the person nearing the car, still engaged in capturing the moment with their camera or phone.(trust the caption **only if** it **explicitly** mentions evidence that fully supports another answer. **Events that are not mentioned should not be considered as incorrect.**)
