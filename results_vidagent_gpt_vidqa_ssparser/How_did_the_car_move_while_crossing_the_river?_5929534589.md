The vehicle is positioned facing the ocean, and the background showcases a calm sea under a clear blue sky. The beach appears relatively empty, with only a few footprints visible in the sand. As the scene develops, a person wearing a light-colored jacket and dark shorts enters the frame from the left side, walking towards the SUV. This individual appears to be taking photographs or recording the vehicle's movement. The SUV then starts to move forward slowly through the shallow water, creating ripples and splashes as it progresses. The person continues to follow the vehicle with their camera, capturing its journey across the wet sand and water.

The video continues with the same beach setting, maintaining the focus on the white SUV now partially submerged in the shallow water. The vehicle remains stationary, and the person in the light-colored jacket and dark shorts is seen walking towards it from the right side of the frame. The individual appears to be observing the SUV closely, possibly preparing to take more photographs or record its movements. The background still features the calm sea under a clear blue sky, with no significant changes in the environment. The video wraps up with the person approaching the SUV, while the vehicle stays in the same position in the shallow water.(trust the caption **only if** it **explicitly** mentions evidence that fully supports another answer. **Events that are not mentioned should not be considered as incorrect.**)
