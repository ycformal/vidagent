In the distance, an airplane is seen approaching for landing on a runway. Three individuals are standing near the edge of the field, observing the plane. One person is wearing a blue shirt and holding a camera, another is in a dark jacket and white pants, and the third is in a light-colored shirt and dark pants. The airplane gradually gets closer to the runway, maintaining its approach path. The scene continues with the airplane now much closer to the runway, still descending towards it. The three individuals remain in their positions, watching the plane's descent. The airplane is now almost directly above the runway, preparing to land. The final scene shows the airplane on the runway, having just landed. It is stationary on the tarmac, with the surrounding area including some trees and a few structures visible in the background. The three individuals are no longer in the frame, but the airplane remains the focal point as it comes to a complete stop on the runway.(trust the caption **only if** it **explicitly** mentions evidence that fully supports another answer. Otherwise trust VLM more. **Events that are not mentioned should not be considered as incorrect.**)
