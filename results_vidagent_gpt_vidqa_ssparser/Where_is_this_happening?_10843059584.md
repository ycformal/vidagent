The third bullet point says: "Working with objects and directing a summer camp." Below these points, there are two images: one of a building labeled "University of Pennsylvania" and another of a person working with objects in a museum setting.

As the presentation continues, the slide transitions to another section titled "More Background." This new section lists additional educational achievements: "Graduate school at Florida State University," "Master's degree in Classical Archaeology," "Excavated in Athens, Greece," and "Museum Studies Certificate, Tallahassee, Florida." The slide also includes two images: one showing a sandy archaeological site with artifacts and another depicting a museum exhibit with various artifacts.

Throughout the video, the woman continues to speak, providing further details about her background and experiences. The setting remains consistent, with the focus on the speaker and the informative slides displayed behind her.(trust the caption **only if** it **explicitly** mentions evidence that fully supports another answer.
