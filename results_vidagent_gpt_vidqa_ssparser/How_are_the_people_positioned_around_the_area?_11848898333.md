The terrain is rocky and uneven, with patches of snow and ice visible on the slopes. The sky is overcast, contributing to a misty atmosphere that partially obscures the distant peaks. The camera slowly pans across the scene, revealing more of the glacier and the surrounding mountains, which are steep and covered in dark rock. The ground is wet, indicating recent or ongoing precipitation. The overall mood is one of cold, harsh weather conditions.

The scene continues to focus on the glacier and the surrounding rocky terrain, maintaining the misty and overcast atmosphere. The camera remains steady, providing a detailed view of the glacier's icy surface and the rugged mountains. The ground remains wet, reinforcing the impression of recent or ongoing precipitation. The overall mood remains cold and harsh.

The perspective shifts slightly, offering a closer view of the glacier and the rocky terrain. The misty and overcast sky continues to obscure parts of the distant peaks. The camera then pans to reveal a group of people standing on the rocky ground. They are dressed in heavy rain gear, including bright yellow and blue jackets, indicating they are prepared for the harsh weather conditions. The group appears to be observing the glacier and the surrounding landscape. The overall mood remains cold and harsh.

The focus remains on the group of people standing on the rocky ground, dressed in heavy rain gear. The person in the bright yellow jacket is prominently visible, along with others in blue jackets. The background shows the glacier and the rugged mountains, consistent with the previous scenes. The ground is wet, and the overcast sky contributes to the misty atmosphere. The group appears to be engaged in conversation or observation, with some individuals holding umbrellas to shield themselves from the rain. The overall mood remains cold and harsh.
