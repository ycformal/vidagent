The background shows a carpeted floor and part of a room with white walls and a door frame visible. As the hand squeezes the stress ball, it deforms and reveals small red balls inside. These red balls gradually push through the surface of the green stress ball, creating a visually appealing contrast between the green exterior and the red interior. The hand continues to squeeze the stress ball, causing more red balls to emerge and fill the space where the green balls were initially visible. The sequence repeats several times, showing the transformation from a green stress ball to one filled with red balls.

The video then transitions to another close-up of a hand holding a similar green stress ball with a honeycomb pattern. This time, the hand is squeezing the stress ball in a different manner, causing the green balls to deform and push through the surface. The background remains consistent with the previous scene, featuring a carpeted floor and part of a room with white walls and a door frame visible. The hand continues to squeeze the stress ball, but this time, the green balls are pushed outwards, revealing more of the green honeycomb pattern. The sequence focuses on the deformation of the stress ball and the movement of the green balls within it, providing a detailed view of the texture and structure of the stress ball.(trust the caption **only if** it **explicitly** mentions evidence that fully supports another answer.
